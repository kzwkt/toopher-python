#ToopherPython
===========================================
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/toopher/toopher-python.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/toopher/toopher-python)

#### Introduction
ToopherPython is a Toopher API library that simplifies the task of interfacing with the Toopher API from Python code.  This project wrangles all the required OAuth and JSON functionality so you can focus on just using the API.

#### Python Version
>=2.6.0

#### Learn the Toopher API
Make sure you visit [https://dev.toopher.com](https://dev.toopher.com) to get acquainted with the Toopher API fundamentals.  The documentation there will tell you the details about the operations this API wrapper library provides.

#### OAuth Authentication
First off, to access the Toopher API you'll need to sign up for an account at the [Toopher developers portal](https://dev.toopher.com) and create a "requester". When that process is complete, your requester is issued OAuth 1.0a credentials in the form of a consumer key and secret. Your key is used to identify your requester when Toopher interacts with your customers, and the secret is used to sign each request so that we know it is generated by you.  This library properly formats each request with your credentials automatically.

#### The Toopher Two-Step
Interacting with the Toopher web service involves two steps: pairing, and authenticating.

##### Pair
Before you can enhance your website's actions with Toopher, your customers will need to pair their phone's Toopher app with your website.  To do this, they generate a unique, nonsensical "pairing phrase" from within the app on their phone.  You will need to prompt them for a pairing phrase as part of the Toopher enrollment process.  Once you have a pairing phrase, just send it to the Toopher web service and we'll return a pairing ID that you can use whenever you want to authenticate an action for that user.

##### Authenticate
You have complete control over what actions you want to authenticate using Toopher (for example: logging in, changing account information, making a purchase, etc.).  Just send us the user's pairing ID, a name for the terminal they're using, and a description of the action they're trying to perform and we'll make sure they actually want it to happen.

#### Librarified
This library makes it super simple to do the Toopher two-step.  Check it out:

```python
from toopher import *

# Create an API Object Using Your Credentials
api = toopher.ToopherApi("<your consumer key>", "<your consumer secret>")

# Step 1 - Pair with their phone's Toopher app
# With pairing phrase
pairing = api.pair("username@yourservice.com", "pairing phrase")
# With SMS (country_code optional)
pairing = api.pair("username@yourservice.com", "555-555-5555", country_code="1")
# With QR code
pairing = api.pair("username@yourservice.com")

# Step 2 - Authenticate a log in
# With pairing_id and terminal_name
auth = api.authenticate(pairing.id, "my computer")
# With username and terminal name and/or requester_specified_id
auth = api.authenticate("username", terminal_name="terminal_name", requester_specified_id = "requester_specified_id")

# Once they've responded you can then check the status
auth.refresh_from_server()
if (auth.pending == False and auth.granted == True):
	# Success!
```

#### Zero-Storage Usage Option
Requesters can choose to integrate the Toopher API in a way does not require storing any per-user data such as Pairing ID and Terminal ID - all of the storage
is handled by the Toopher API Web Service, allowing your local database to remain unchanged.  If the Toopher API needs more data, it will `raise()` a specific
error that allows your code to respond appropriately.

```python
try:
    # optimistically try to authenticate against Toopher API with username and a Terminal Identifier
    # Terminal Identifer is typically a randomly generated secure browser cookie.  It does not
    # need to be human-readable
    auth = api.authenticate("username", "requester_specified_id")

    # if you got here, everything is good!  poll the auth request as described above
    # there are four distinct errors ToopherAPI can return if it needs more data
except UserDisabledError:
    # you have marked this user as disabled in the Toopher API.
except UserUnknownError:
    # This user has not yet paired a mobile device with their account.  Pair them
    # using api.pair() as described above, then re-try authentication
except TerminalUnknownError:
    # This user has not assigned a "Friendly Name" to this terminal identifier.
    # Prompt them to enter a terminal name, then submit that "friendly name" to
    # the Toopher API:
    #   api.advanced.user_terminals.create("username", "terminal_name", "requester_specified_id")
    # Afterwards, re-try authentication
except PairingDeactivatedError:
    # this user does not have an active pairing,
    # typically because they deleted the pairing.  You can prompt
    # the user to re-pair with a new mobile device.
```

#### Handling Errors
If any request runs into an error a `ToopherApiError` will be thrown with more details on what went wrong.

#### Dependencies
This library uses the [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/) library and [OAuthLib](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/oauthlib) to handle OAuth signing and to make the web requests.

Toopher uses [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) to install packages.

To ensure all dependencies are up-to-date run:
```shell
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Demo
Check out `demo.py` for an example program that walks you through the whole process!  Just download the contents of this repo, make sure you have the dependencies listed above installed, and then run it like-a-this:
```shell
$ python ./demo.py
```

#### Tests
To run tests enter:
```shell
$ nosetests test
```

#Authentication Using the Toopher `<iframe>`
===========================================
Toopher's `<iframe>`-based authentication flow is the simplest way for web developers to integrate Toopher Two-Factor Authentication into an application.

## Toopher `<iframe>` Authentication Overview

The `iframe`-based authentication flow works by inserting an `<iframe>` element into the HTML displayed to the user after a successful username/password validation (but before they are actually logged-in to the service).  The iframe URL is generated by our library and its content is served from the Toopher API server.  The iframe guides the user through the process of authenticating with Toopher.  Once complete, the iframe will return the result of the authentication to your server by `POST`ing the response via HTML to an endpoint of your choice.  Your server validates the cryptographic signature using our library which determines whether or not the user successfully authenticated.

Two distinct iframe flows are required:

* the *Pairing* request is used to pair a user account with a particular mobile device (this is typically a one-time process)
* the *Authentication* request to authenticate a particular action on behalf of a user

## Authentication Workflow
### Primary Authentication
We recommend using some form of primary authentication before initiating a Toopher authentication request.  Typical primary authentication methods involve verifying that the user has a valid username and password to access the resource being protected.

### Step 1: Embed a request in an `<iframe>`
After verifying the user's primary authentication, but before Assuming the user's primary authentication checks out, the next step is to kickoff Toopher authentication.

1. Generate a URL by specifying the request parameters to the library as detailed below
1. Display a webpage to your user that embeds this URL within an iframe element.  The markup requirements for the iframe element are described in the "HTML Markup" section

### Step 2: Validate the result
1. Toopher-iframe results posted back to server
1. Server calls `ToopherIframe.validate_postback()` to verify that result is valid.  `.validate_postback()` returns a `Map` of trusted data if the signature is valid, or throws a `SignatureValidationError` if the signature is invalid.
1. The server should check for possible errors returned by the API in the `error_code` map entry
1. If no errors were returned, the result of the authentication is in the `granted` map entry

## HTML Markup
The `<iframe>` element must have an id of `toopher_iframe`.

Pages that include the Toopher Authentication or Pairing iframe must include the accompanying javascript library `toopher-web.js` (located in `/assets/js/` in this repository).  Toopher's Authentication and Pairing `<iframe>` content is designed for a minimum size of 400x300 px.  In the example below, `{{IFRAME_REQUEST_URL}}` is the Authentication or Pairing URL generated by the ToopherIframe library.  `{{POSTBACK_URL}}` is the path on your server where the Toopher-Iframe will submit the result of the authentication when it is finished.

```html
<!-- toopher-web.js requires jQuery.  uncomment the following line to source it from CDNJS if it is not already included in your page -->
<!-- <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.0/jquery.min.js"></script> -->
<script src="/js/toopher-web.js"></script>
<iframe id="toopher_iframe" src="{{IFRAME_REQUEST_URL}}" toopher_postback="{{POSTBACK_URL}}" style="display:inline-block; height:300px; width:100%;"></iframe>
```

There is no difference in the markup required for a Pairing vs. an Authentication iframe request (the generated URL embeds all relevant information).

## Examples

#### Generating an Authentication iframe URL
Every Toopher Authentication session should include a unique `request_token` - a randomized string that is included in the signed request to the Toopher API and returned in the signed response from the Toopher `<iframe>`.  To guard against potential replay attacks, your code should validate that the returned `request_token` is the same one used to create the request.

Creating a random request token and storing it in the server-side session using Django:

```python
import random, string
request_token = ''.join(random.choice(string.lowercase + string.digits) for i in range(15))
request.session['ToopherRequestToken'] = request_token
```

The Toopher Authentication API provides the requester a rich set of controls over authentication parameters.
(Optional parameters: reset_email, request_token, action_name, requester_metadata, automation_allowed, challenge_required, and ttl)

```python
auth_iframe_url = iframe_api.get_authentication_url(username, reset_email, request_token, action_name, requester_metadata, automation_allowed=automation_allowed, challenge_required=challenge_required, ttl=ttl);
```

For the simple case of authenticating a user at login, use `get_authentication_url` in this simple way:

```python
login_iframe_url = iframe_api.get_authentication_url(username)
```

#### Generating a Pairing iframe URL
(Optional parameter: reset_email)

```python
pair_iframe_url = iframe_api.get_user_management_url(username)
```

#### Validating Postback Data from Authentication iframe & Parsing Errors
In this example, `data` is a `dict` of the form data POSTed to your server from the Toopher Authentication iframe.  You should replace the commented blocks in the `except` with code appropriate for the condition described in the comment.

There are two ways to validate postback data:

```python
try:
    # returns an AuthenticationRequest
    authentication_request = iframe_api.process_postback(form_data)

    if not authentication_request.pending and authentication_request.granted:
        # Success!
except toopher.UserDisableError as e:
    # Toopher authentication has been disabled for this user
except toopher.SignatureValidationError as e:
    # postback was not valid
    # (missing keys, incorrect session token, signature has expired, signature invalid)
except toopher.ToopherApiError as e:
    # postback resource type was not valid
```

```python
# returns boolean indicating if user should be granted access
authentication_request_granted = iframe_api.is_authentication_granted(form_data)

if authentication_request_granted:
    # Success!
```

#### Validating Postback Data from Pairing iframe & Parsing Errors
In this example, `data` is a `dict` of the form data POSTed to your server from the Toopher Pairing iframe.  You should replace the commented blocks in the `except` with code appropriate for the condition described in the comment.

```python
try:
    # returns a Pairing or User
    postback_object = iframe_api.process_postback(form_data)
except toopher.UserDisableError as e:
    # Toopher authentication has been disabled for this user
except toopher.SignatureValidationError as e:
    # postback was not valid
    # (missing keys, incorrect session token, signature has expired, signature invalid)
except toopher.ToopherApiError as e:
    # postback resource type was not valid
```
